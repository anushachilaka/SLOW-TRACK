what is a structure in c?
structure is a user defined data type in which we can define many attributes of same or different data types.
example:structure to represent the triangle.
        struct triangle 
        {
         float base;
         float height;
         float area;
        }
        
what is an array in c?
array is also a structured data type in which we can define many attributes of the same data types.
Array can be used to represent not only simple list of data but also table of data in two or three dimensions.

declaring an array:
data-type variable-name[size];

/* Example of array declaration */

int arr[10];
-here int is the data type arr is the variable name and [10] is the size of the array i.e, that particular array can have 
ten elements of int data type.

how to initialize an array?
to initialize an array we give the list of values the array should take for example
int marks[4]={ 67, 87, 56, 77 };    // integer array initialization

float area[5]={ 23.4, 6.8, 5.5 };   // float array initialization
